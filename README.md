# Checkers-Python-MZ

Should be fully working as of 06/05/20

How to run:
'python3 Checkers.py'


Originally designed to work on windows (should work fine)
MacOS and any similar linux/unix systems may have some issues with menu switching
(currently fixing some issues whenever I have freetime)

Removed the ability to return to a current game (due to issues on macos)
Instead everytime you return to the main menu, the current game is reset.

Please report any issues to me:
